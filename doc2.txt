simple : fights happen at close range. Yes.


move if needed.

So, when a character attacks its prey : 1/5 lp/s.


when any character attacks a titan, it loses 1/20.

The titan makes 50% damage/s;

So, you need more than 10 armies (any character), or a titan, to beat it.


To kill a druid : 1/10 /s pour une faction;


useless to leave, because you're followed, but stops attacking.

So, the druid would take 1Os to get killed.

The druid is sent if it's protected by an army higher than the other and that the area is cleared.
