The AI starts by checking what the other player has.


So, the AI loops on each of its characters, sorted by order of distance from left. 


So, we loop on each character of the array, and we search into the other player's stack

So : powers


Warrior beats archer

Knights beats Warrior

Hyprogryph beats Warrior

10 archers beats Hyprogryph

no killer for Titans.


Calculated for a combat battle. Damages depend.

In battle :

  Warriors damage 10 lp per second/ 20 lp archers ( 150lp)
  Archers : from long range (1 point/second against warriors) , from close range : 5 point per second (100)
  Knights : 50 points per second()
  Hyprogryphs : long range (fire : 100 point/second ); short range : 30 points/second.


 What's good having archers : drive Hyprogryphs not to fly and attack the castle.


3 maximal Hyprogryphs.


Time of building :

You can add a next task, delete a task to your druid.


function search(){



  //check if matches with current opponents. If not, don't do anything with the rest of the players (they wil be useful for the next attack).



          //So, first, two arrays :
           
          //On


  //build players to match the players.


  //Behaviour? For all the players on the board, attack the closest matching player.


  //when no players not matched, if the middle is available, send the druid to enter the dark dimension , and collect dark energy.
